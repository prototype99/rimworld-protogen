	<description>A mod that I work on in my spare time, and one of the most polished races I have created so far.

Based off of an old version of Jack's Sergal mod, with his permission to create my own stuff. He's quite a good friend indeed.

[h1]Version : 1e[/h1]
	It's now 1.6 compatible, thanks to other games sucking rn.
	
	[b]I encourage using a new save game rather than an older one from a previous version due to rewritten assets![/b]
	
	[b]Any new elements cannot be promised to be backported to earlier versions, but I'll give it a try where possible.[/b]

	Credits :
	[url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198182079259]ShauaPuta[/url] - For aiding in setting up new colourful face masks for the Protogen, a bit of bonus variety to make them pop visually.
