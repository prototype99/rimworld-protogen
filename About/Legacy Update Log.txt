V0.2
    This mod adds a custom race, Protogen. Adds a new weapon temporarily, and has more of the content used from elsewhere removed.
		
V0.3
    Adds 2 new traits, No Mither (Exclusive to Protogen) and Flammability. Weapon now has a texture, albeit not that good. Several minute fixes too. 	

V0.4
   Updated to 1.1, old version for 1.0 remains available and unchanged, may return to fix at one point.

V0.5
   Added the Zeus, a taser which incapacitates enemies as a new weapon, which is part of the research for the custom race.

V0.6
   Updated the Zeus, as to prevent it spawning within trader inventory and in raids. (Will look further into this to resolve.)

V0.7
   Fixed some minor errors that would appear on startup, planning to do more in future.

V0.8
   Added a 1.2 compatiable version for the game.

V0.9
   Added a 1.3 compatiable version for the game, along with some additional names, and a few tweaks to content. Fingers Crossed it's all good.

[h1]Version : 1a[/h1]
	Updated to Rimworld 1.4. New Names in generator, New Faces to be seen.
	
	This is a first round of updates for this mod, and I think delaying a release may hurt more than help.
	
	[b]I encourage using a new save game rather than an older one from a previous version due to rewritten assets![/b]
	
	[i][b](A bug may cause Faces to not generate for a few units, primarily from traders/encounters. Mostly Harmless it seems, but I'm seeing if there's a fix.)[/b][/i]

A mod that I work on in my spare time, and one of the most polished races I have created so far.

Based off of an old version of Jack's Sergal mod, with his permission to create my own stuff. He's quite a good friend indeed.

[h1]Version : 1b[/h1]
	Even more Names in generator, Faces have received a new facelift (so to speak).
	
	Fixes for the disappearing head, and possibly some unknown bugs have been tentatively applied.
	
	[b]I encourage using a new save game rather than an older one from a previous version due to rewritten assets![/b]
	
	[b]Any new elements cannot be promised to be backported to earlier versions, but I'll give it a try where possible.[/b]
